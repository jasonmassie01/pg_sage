# pg_sage — Autonomous PostgreSQL DBA Agent

## What This Is

pg_sage is an autonomous PostgreSQL DBA agent that continuously monitors, analyzes, and maintains PostgreSQL databases. It runs as an **external Go sidecar process** that connects to Postgres over the standard wire protocol — no C extension, no shared_preload_libraries. It combines a deterministic rules engine (Tier 1), optional LLM-enhanced analysis (Tier 2), and a trust-ramped action executor (Tier 3).

**License:** AGPL-3.0
**Module:** `github.com/pg-sage/sidecar`
**Go:** 1.24
**Target:** PostgreSQL 14+
**Tests:** 771+ test functions, 0 failures
**Modes:** Standalone (single DB) and Fleet (multi-DB from one sidecar)

## Architecture

### Core Goroutines (per database instance)

1. **Collector** — snapshots `pg_stat_statements`, `pg_stat_user_tables`, `pg_stat_user_indexes`, sequences, replication state
2. **Analyzer** — Tier 1 rules engine, generates findings, invokes Tier 3 action executor at sufficient trust
3. **Briefing** — periodic Tier 2 health briefings when LLM is enabled
4. **Optimizer** — LLM-powered index recommendations (optional)
5. **Advisor** — LLM-powered config tuning: vacuum, WAL, connections, memory (optional)

### Tier 1 — Rules Engine (deterministic)
Index health (duplicates, unused, missing, bloat), query performance (slow queries, regressions, seq scans on large tables), sequence exhaustion, vacuum/bloat/dead tuples, config audit, security, replication monitoring, self-monitoring.

### Tier 2 — LLM-Enhanced (optional)
Daily briefings, interactive diagnose (ReAct loop), explain narrative, index optimization, config advising. Pluggable LLM provider via OpenAI-compatible endpoint (covers Gemini, OpenAI, Groq, Ollama, etc).

### Tier 3 — Action Executor
Trust-ramped: OBSERVATION (day 0-7, findings only) → ADVISORY (day 8-30, SAFE actions) → AUTONOMOUS (day 31+, MODERATE actions). HIGH-risk always requires manual confirmation. All actions logged with rollback metadata.

### Fleet Mode (v0.8.0)
One sidecar binary monitors N databases. `fleet.DatabaseManager` wraps instances. Standalone mode auto-normalizes into `Databases[0]`. REST API + React dashboard on `:8080`.

### Safety
Circuit breakers for DB and LLM. Emergency stop halts all autonomous activity. Per-database token budgets in fleet mode.

## Tech Stack

- **Postgres driver:** `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5` + `pgxpool`
- **Testing:** `go test` (no testify — uses stdlib `testing` package)
- **Config:** `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` + env vars + runtime overrides via `sage.config` table
- **Logging:** `log/slog` (structured, stdlib)
- **Frontend:** React 19 + Vite + Tailwind CSS v4 + Recharts + lucide-react
- **Embedding:** `go:embed` for React build assets in Go binary
- **Release:** goreleaser (builds linux/darwin amd64/arm64)

## Testing Strategy

1100+ tests using stdlib `testing` package. Three levels:

1. **Unit tests** (`*_test.go`) — rules, config parsing, fleet manager, API handlers, optimizer, advisor
2. **Integration tests** (`//go:build integration`) — real HTTP via httptest, fleet scenarios
3. **Schema tests** — require local PostgreSQL on port 5432 (bootstrap, idempotency)

## Testing Standards

### Core Principle
Tests exist to **find bugs**, not to prove code works. A test suite that always passes is suspicious. If you write tests and they all pass on the first run, you probably wrote weak tests.

### Rules — Violations Are Blockers

1. **No silent skips.** After every `go test` run, grep output for `SKIP`, `TODO`, and `PENDING`. Report skipped tests explicitly with reasons. A skipped test is NOT a passing test. Do not report "all tests pass" if any test was skipped.

2. **No cached results.** Always run tests with `-count=1` to defeat Go's test cache. A cached pass is not a real pass.

3. **Coverage is mandatory.** Run `go test -cover -count=1 ./...` and report per-package coverage. If any package with business logic falls below 70%, write additional tests before reporting completion. Utility/helper packages have a 50% floor.

4. **Assertions must be specific.** `assert.NoError(err)` alone is never sufficient. Every test must also assert the actual return value, state change, or side effect. If a test would still pass with the function body replaced by `return nil, nil`, the test is broken.

5. **Never modify a test to make it pass.** If a test fails, fix the implementation. The only reason to modify a test is if the test itself contains a logical error — and if you do, explain exactly what was wrong with the test before changing it.

### Test Writing Process (Two Phases — Do Not Combine)

**Phase 1: Write tests.** Write all tests based on the spec or feature description. Include every category below. Do NOT run them yet. Commit or stage them.

**Phase 2: Run and fix.** Run the full suite. Fix implementation bugs that tests reveal. Track what failed and why. Report a summary of bugs found.

If you write tests and run them in the same step, you will unconsciously write tests that pass. Separating the phases eliminates this bias.

### Required Test Categories

For every feature, function, or component, tests must cover:

| Category | What to test | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Happy path** | Expected input → expected output | Valid query → correct index recommendation |
| **Invalid input** | Malformed, wrong-type, or out-of-range input | Empty string query, negative threshold, SQL injection strings |
| **Nil/empty/zero** | nil pointers, empty slices, zero-value structs, empty maps | `nil` config, `[]QueryStat{}`, zero `ConfidenceScore` |
| **Error propagation** | Caller receives a meaningful, distinguishable error | DB connection refused → error contains "connection" not just "failed" |
| **Boundary conditions** | Thresholds, limits, cutoffs, window edges | `unused_index_window_days=0` vs `=1` vs `=7`, trust level boundaries |
| **Concurrent access** | Race conditions under parallel execution | Two advisors writing recommendations simultaneously |
| **State transitions** | Trust ramp levels, executor gating, mode changes | `monitor` → `advisory` → `auto`, fleet mode vs single mode |
| **Integration** | Real or dockerized Postgres, actual SQL execution | Index created via `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, vacuum actually runs |

If a category genuinely doesn't apply to a component, write a comment explaining why: `// No concurrent access tests: this function is stateless and takes no shared references`

### Negative Testing Is Not Optional

For every happy-path test, ask: "What should happen when this goes wrong?" Then write that test. Specifically:

- **LLM responses:** Malformed JSON, markdown-wrapped JSON, empty response, timeout, rate limit error
- **PostgreSQL errors:** Connection lost mid-query, permission denied, table doesn't exist, extension not installed
- **Config values:** Missing keys, zero values where defaults are expected, conflicting settings
- **Executor actions:** DDL that fails mid-execution, `CONCURRENTLY` that can't acquire lock, vacuum on a table in a transaction

### Post-Test Audit (Run After Every Test Session)

After all tests pass, answer these questions for each test file:

1. **What input would break this that I haven't tested?**
2. **What behavior is NOT covered by any assertion?**
3. **Are there assertions that would pass even if the feature was completely broken?** (e.g., only checking `err == nil` without checking the result)
4. **Are there any test doubles (mocks/stubs) that hide real failure modes?** (e.g., mocking the DB so you never test actual SQL)

Fix every gap found. Report what was added.

### Verification Checklist Pattern

For integration and end-to-end testing, use the numbered checklist format:

```
CHECK-01: [PASS/FAIL] Fleet mode discovers all 3 databases
CHECK-02: [PASS/FAIL] REST API /api/databases returns correct count
CHECK-03: [PASS/FAIL] Executor respects trust_level=monitor (no actions taken)
...
```

- Every check must be programmatically verifiable where possible
- Checks that require manual verification must be tagged: `// MANUAL: requires browser inspection of dashboard`
- A checklist with any FAIL is a failing test run, even if individual unit tests pass
- Do not report success until every CHECK is PASS or explicitly acknowledged as MANUAL

### Known Failure Patterns to Watch For

These are bugs Claude Code has introduced in the past. Test for them proactively:

- **Default value masking:** Config values defaulting to zero instead of their intended default (e.g., `unused_index_window_days` defaulting to 0 instead of 7). Write tests that verify defaults without any config file present.
- **Markdown-wrapped LLM responses:** Gemini wrapping JSON in ```json fences. Test that `stripToJSON` handles this everywhere LLM output is parsed.
- **Transaction scope errors:** Operations like VACUUM that cannot run inside a transaction. Test that these use dedicated connections.
- **Fleet mode leaks:** Values like `database_name` returning "all" instead of the actual database name. Test per-database context isolation.
- **Confidence score boundaries:** Verify the optimizer reaches advisory threshold (0.5) without HypoPG. Test with and without HypoPG available.

### Reporting Format

After any test run, report in this exact format:

```
## Test Results

**Command:** `go test -cover -count=1 ./...`
**Total:** X passed, Y failed, Z skipped
**Coverage:** [per-package breakdown]

### Skipped Tests (must be zero or justified)
- pkg/analyzer: TestComplexJoinDetection — SKIPPED: requires pg_stat_statements (CI limitation)

### Failures (if any)
- pkg/executor: TestVacuumDedicatedConn — FAIL: vacuum attempted inside transaction

### Coverage Gaps (packages below threshold)
- pkg/fleet: 58% — missing tests for DatabaseManager connection pooling

### Bugs Found This Session
1. [BUG] executor.go:142 — VACUUM not using dedicated connection
2. [BUG] config.go:87 — unused_index_window_days defaults to 0, not 7

### Manual Checks Remaining
- CHECK-12: MANUAL — Dashboard dark mode toggle (requires browser)
```

No test session is complete without this report. "All tests pass" is never an acceptable summary.

### Coverage Gaps Are Mandatory Output

After every test run, you MUST report per-package coverage gaps — packages below the threshold (70% for business logic, 50% for utilities). Run `go test -cover -count=1 ./...` and parse the coverage output. If any package is below threshold, list it with the missing test areas. If all packages meet thresholds, explicitly state "All packages meet coverage thresholds" with the actual numbers. Never omit this section.

## Code Style & Conventions

- **Go version:** 1.24 (use range-over-func, slog, etc.)
- **Naming:** PascalCase exported, camelCase internal
- **Packages:** `internal/` for everything. No public library API.
- **Errors:** Wrap with `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`. Sentinel errors for known conditions.
- **Logging:** `log/slog` with structured fields
- **Context:** First argument on all I/O functions. Respect cancellation.
- **Database:** `pgxpool` only. Parameterized queries (`$1`). Never string-concat SQL.
- **Config:** YAML + env vars. Validate at startup, fail fast.
- **Interfaces:** Define at consumer. Keep small (1-3 methods).

## Dependencies (keep minimal)

- `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5` — Postgres driver + pool
- `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` — config parsing
- `github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify` — config hot reload
- `github.com/google/uuid` — finding/action IDs
- No ORM. No web framework. No DI container. No testify.

## What NOT To Do

- Do not use `database/sql` — use `pgx` native interface
- Do not use global mutable state — pass dependencies explicitly
- Do not ignore `context.Context` cancellation
- Do not hardcode connection strings — always config/env
- Do not store secrets in source — env vars or secret manager
- Do not skip error wrapping — bare `return err` loses context
- Do not use `panic` for recoverable errors
- Do not add dependencies without justification — stdlib first
- Do not modify existing migration files — append new numbered ones
- Do not edit `internal/api/dist/` manually — it's generated by `npm run build`
